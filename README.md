This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in a Firebase web application where Firestore write operations intermittently fail without throwing any errors. The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` presents the solution. The issue stems from a lack of proper error handling and asynchronous operation management within the Firebase write function.  The solution implements robust error handling and ensures that asynchronous operations are properly awaited and managed using async/await syntax.
